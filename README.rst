THIS PROJECT IS ARCHIVED
========================

ara-web was meant to be a react+patternfly javascript interface to the `ara <https://github.com/ansible-community/ara-web>` API.

It used to work but due to lack of time, interest, traction and contributors, ara-web has not kept up with the API changes
and the features provided by the built-in ara reporting interface.

ara-web is now retired to avoid confusing users and contributors alike.

For more information, see this issue: https://github.com/ansible-community/ara-web/issues/45
