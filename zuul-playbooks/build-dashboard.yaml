  environment:
    PUBLIC_URL: './'
    # NOTE: using "./" is not enough to support html5 links, even with
    # rewrite rules for unknown files, accessing 'job/devstack' will make
    # the dashboard load static files from 'job/static/...'
    # This works for the preview dashboard that can only be loaded from the
    # npm/html directory anyway.
